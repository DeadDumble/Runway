Final Project: Runway Reservation System

This package contains the fully functional and debugged implementation of the BST-based 
runway reservation system. All files have been updated to the assignment 
requirements and properly implement recursive functions for:
1. Conflict Checking (`checkConflict()`)
2. Plane Insertion (`insert()`)
3. Plane Counting (`countPlanes()`)

FILES INCLUDED:
- reserve.cpp: Implementation of the BST reservation system.
- reserve.h: Header file defining the BST structure.
- mainR.cpp: Main driver program to test the system.
- README.txt: This file, explaining the contents and changes made.
